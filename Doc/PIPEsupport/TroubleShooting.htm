  <P>
   Listed below are a few tips that may help to determine the cause of a 
   suspected problem with the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">P</SPAN>roduction
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">I</SPAN>nformation <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">P</SPAN>anCIM
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">E</SPAN>xporter program.</P>
  <P>
   &nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   The first action for any suspected problem with this program should 
   be to (1) make sure it's actually listed as running in the 
   InfoPlus.21 Manager and (2) if it is, find out if it's responding to events.</P>
  <P>
   If it's not running, start it. The first place to check if the 
   program is responding is to look at the OracleJobManager record in 
   the InfoPlus.21 database.</P>
  <P>
   The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">CURRENT_STATUS</SPAN> field 
   should contain <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">OK</SPAN> and the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">LAST_LOG_TIME</SPAN> 
   should have a timestamp no less than the current time minus the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">RESCHEDULE_INTERVAL</SPAN> 
   value. Unless there is a large amount of Oracle job records to 
   process, you should never see the text <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Processing</SPAN> 
   in the CURRENT_STATUS field. If you do, the program is 
   &quot;hung&quot; and will need to be shut down through the Microsoft 
   Task Manager and restarted through the InfoPlus.21 Manager.</P>

  <P>
   The program also writes the count of added, modified and removed 
   records in the appropriate fields after every activation. The 
   LOGS_IN_MEMORY repeat area should have two entries for each 
   activation interval with a recent LOG_TIME timestamp. Each activation 
   time should have a status entry of <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Processing</SPAN> 
   and then <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">OK</SPAN>.</P>

   Another source for troubleshooting other suspected problem is the <A HREF="LogFiles.htm">PIPE.LOG</A> 
   file. </P>
  <P>

  <P>
   Several events are recorded in this file. Most of the entries are 
   simply informational but all warnings and/or errors detected by the 
   program are prefixed with *** in the left margin. In the sample above 
   there is a warning that job 11343825 was completed by Oracle but is 
   still listed as running in PanCIM. This can occur when someone 
   transacts a production quantity in Oracle that satifies the planned 
   quantity and does not stop the order in PanCIM. </P>
