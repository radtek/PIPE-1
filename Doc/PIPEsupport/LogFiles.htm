  <P>
   The Production Information PanCIM Exporter program writes information 
   into a log file for many events. The name of this file is <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">PIPE.LOG</SPAN>.
    It is located in the SETCIMLOGS folder and can be read with any 
   ASCII editor such as notepad. Unlike the typical InfoPlus.21 
   &quot;out&quot; files, this log file is closed after each entry 
   written which allows the viewing all current data without the need to 
   stop the program. It is a good resource for <A HREF="TroubleShooting.htm">troubleshooting</A> 
   problems associated with TSK_PIPE.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">In
    order to keep all the log files from growing very large, they are 
   automatically renamed every 24 hours with the date of the month 
   appended to the end of the file name. The PIPE program will create a 
   new file if the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">PIPE.LOG</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> 
   file name does already not exist.</SPAN></P>
