                                 update the job history table if the IP21 workorder record does not 
                                 exist. Changed number of IP21 workorder record retention days to 90.

                                 update the job history table if the IP21 workorder record does not

                                 being unloaded from memeory. Next call requiring AtTime.dll would crash 
                                 program.

                                 to eliminate differences in Oracle server timestamps. Suggested by EZW
 06/13/07     2.1    008   WRC   Added Burr Ridge organization ID. Expanded maximum number of departments to 20.

 11/27/07     2.2    005   WRC   Removed time adjustment when DST flag is set. Flag does not indicate DST is actually
                                 in effect as I thought it did. It only indicates that the system time should be automatically
                                 adjusted when DST is in effect.
 05/19/08     2.2    006   WRC   Added error trap for no free IP21 record IDs in CreateOracleJobRecord routine.

                                 errors are detected.
 06/02/08     2.2    008   WRC   Added MACHINE_NAME <> OFFLINE filter in Oracle query to minimize processing these records.
 06/19/08     2.2    009   WRC   Added adjustment for local DST time to match Oracle CST timestamps.
 05/28/09     2.2    009a  WRC   Changed WIP DSNs to use Oracle 11.1 ODBC connection
